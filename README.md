# Meteor Flashcards

A simple flashcard application built with the awesome [Meteor framework](https://github.com/meteor/meteor). Work in progress!

## Installation

Download/clone this repository, run *mrt update* to download the required packages and then start the application by running *meteor*. Or simply run *mrt* and Meteorite will automatically download the required packages and start Meteor!

## Demo

From time to time I will upload the current version to [flashcards2.meteor.com](http://flashcards2.meteor.com).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
